The problem of partitioning an orthogonal polyhedron into a minimum number of boxes was shown to be NP-hard in 1991, but no approximability result is known except for a 4-approximation algorithm for 3D-histograms. 
In this paper we broaden the understanding of the 3D-histogram partitioning problem. 
We prove that partitioning a 3D-histogram into a minimum number of boxes is NP-hard, even for histograms of height two. 
This settles an open question posed by Floderus et al. 
We then show the problem to be APX-hard for histograms of height four. 
On the positive side, we give polynomial-time algorithms to compute optimal or approximate box partitions for some restricted but
interesting classes of polyhedra and 3D-histograms.
