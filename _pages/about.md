I'm Alexi Turcotte, a recent Ph.D. graduate from Northeastern University.
I was co-advised by Frank Tip and Jan Vitek; I worked with Frank primarily on program analysis, refactoring, and optimizations for JavaScript, and with Jan on type systems, language design, and fuzzing for the R programming language.

I'm doing a postdoc with Andreas Zeller at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, in Saabr√ºcken, Germany.
