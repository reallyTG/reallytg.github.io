I'm Alexi Turcotte, a fifth year PhD candidate at Northeastern University. 
I'm co-advised by Frank Tip and Jan Vitek; I work with Frank primarily on program analysis, refactoring, and optimizations for JavaScript, and with Jan on type systems, language design, and fuzzing for the R programming language.
